# GroupMatcher

The program GroupMatcher is based on Go and helps to allocate persons to
groups while trying to fulfill all the given wishes as good as possible.
The program matches the persons with first, second and third wish into
the groups while taking care of the maximum and minimum size that can be
specified for every group.

This useful tool was developed as an IT-project by Justus Ro√ümeier, Christian Obermaier and Max Obermeier.
